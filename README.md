# B-Sharp/B# (Programming Language)

> Will be release in 2029


## Introduction
I really like my B language very much so I made a next version of B language and it's called B# (B#'s interpreter is written in B).  
The B# is quite similar to B but ***it's more flexible*** and ***faster performance.***

***B scripts have the file extension of .bs, .bsharp, .blacks, .blacksharp, .bsx and .ban.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***  

<!---
This programming language will cooperate as a programming language and will support some programming language as a support language. If you are willing to wait then you will see how powerful this programming language in 2029!.
The B language will be written in C++, The B# language will be written in B, and B++ language will be written in B and B#. Thank you. :)
